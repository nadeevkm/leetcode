BFS - forget to add to 'reached' after adding to Queue

DFS - forget to add nodes to visited after 'visit'

Also in Graphs when we get neighbours from neigbList/adjList
not all V can have neighbours, so
    for neighb in adjMap[v]
will throw an error, we need to use default value in adjMap[v] is null , like
    for neighb in adjMap.get(v, set())

While processing some array with some running memory buffer (i.e. count),
don't forget to write data left in memory after processing the last element of array!


---
Forgot about initial filling of DP table
for ex. dp[0][0]

---
Use given table instead of dp[] table in calculations of dp[] cell
